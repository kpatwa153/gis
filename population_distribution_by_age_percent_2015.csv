"Notes"
"The American Community Survey did not release the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to data collection brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. For 2020 data please refer to the [Population Distribution by Age (CPS)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/population-distribution-by-age-cps/). We will continue to report data from the ACS for 2021 and later. Estimates from the CPS are not comparable to estimates from ACS."
